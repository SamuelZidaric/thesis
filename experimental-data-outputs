# C-elegans-Data-Outputs Repository

This repository is where I store and manage the data outputs from my C. elegans experiments. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into directories for different types of experiments. I upload the respective data into these designated directories.

## Guidelines for Data Submission

### Text File with Data

For each experiment, I create a plain text file (.txt format) containing clean data. This file strictly contains raw data, without any commentary or analysis. This format ensures that the data can be easily accessed and used later.

### Optional Descriptive File

If I need to provide any additional context or description for the data, I create a second text file. This file can include information that might be helpful when interpreting or using the data, such as the conditions under which the data was collected, any anomalies observed, etc.

## Filename Convention

To maintain consistency and facilitate easy navigation, I name my files as follows:

- Data file: `Data_<ExperimentType>.txt`
- Description file: `Description_<ExperimentType>.txt`

Replace `<ExperimentType>` with the type of experiment (e.g., ATR+, ATR-, etc.)

## Concluding Note

The primary goal of this repository is to ensure efficient and organized data management for my C. elegans experiments. If you're a visitor to this repository, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification.
